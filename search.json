Presented at the Academy of Management Annual Meeting (2023).\nThis late stage manuscript, presented at the Academy of Management Annual Meeting (2023), investigates the ecological determinents of informal entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on how gender, ethnicity, and urbanization promote informal venturing among disadvantaged populations. It combines a custom dataset of urbanization and social activity derived algorithmically from European Space Agency Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery and National Aeronautics and Space Administration nighttime light emissions imagery with a longitudinal dataset of informal economic activity in Thailand. It is due to be submitted to a Financial Times 50 ranked journal with an expanded authorship team for review in Fall 2024.\nZachlod, Nina, Hudecheck, Michael, Siren, Charlotta, & George, Gerard. Using Satellite Data to Study Societal Grand Challenges. Accepted to the Academy of Management Annual Meeting (2024).\nThis late stage manuscript, scheduled to be presented at the Academy of Management Annual Meeting (2024), explores the role that emerging satellite-based data sources, such as multispectral imagery data, can play in organizational theory and management research. This manuscript was previously under revise and resubmit at Organizational Research Methods and is scheduled to be submitted to a UT Dallas ranked journal for review in Summer 2024."
